	Q: What happens if you print a function/method or class. 
	A: I assume this works like JS or Python does where it prints the type and var name rather than executing the method/function.

3. 
	- Arrays!
	- The ability to pass a variable number of arguments to a function like in Lua (another side effect of no lists/arrays). `fun sum(a, b, ...)`
	- No imports / linking?
